Project Overview
This project analyzes a dataset of female participants to study the relationship between grip strength and frailty. It includes:

Data preprocessing and organization
Different visualization techniques
Analysis of frailty indicators

How to Run
Open Google Colab
Upload frailty_analysis.ipynb
Run all cells to generate visualizations
Check results/figures/ for saved graphs

Requirements
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:

python
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy fpdf

Insights & Findings
Higher grip strength correlates with lower frailty
Aging tends to reduce grip strength
Frail participants generally have lower grip strength
